# Controlled Document Procedure

## Purpose

GitLab deploys control activities through policies and standards that establish what is expected and procedures that put policies and standards into action.

The purpose of this procedure is to ensure that there is consistency in developing and maintaining controlled documents at GitLab utilizing a hierarchal approach for managing legal and regulatory requirements.

There are two types of documentation at GitLab:

1. Controlled Documents: Change-controlled documents pertaining to policies, procedures, standards, or guidelines which are maintained for purposes of regulatory compliance, customer trust, and/or security best practices. Approval of changes is restricted to appropriate maintainers via the CODEOWNERS file.
1. Uncontrolled Documents: All other documents that do not need to be strictly change-controlled.

Everyone at GitLab is welcome and encouraged to submit an MR to create or suggest changes to controlled documents at any time.

## Scope

This procedure applies to all controlled documents developed in support of GitLab's statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements. Uncontrolled documents are dynamic in nature and not in scope of this procedure.

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role  | Responsibility |
|-----------|-----------|
| Security Compliance Team | Responsible for implementing and maintaining Security Policies and oversight of supporting standards and procedures as part of ongoing continuous control monitoring |
| Security Governance Team | Responsible for conducting annual controlled documents review |
| Security Assurance Management (Code Owners) | Responsible for approving changes to this procedure |
| Control Owners | Responsible for defining and implementing procedures to support Security policies and standards |

## Procedure

### Definitions by Hierarchy

- Policy: A policy is a high-level statement of intent and defines GitLab's goals, objectives and culture. Statutory, regulatory, or contractual obligations are commonly the root cause for a policy's existence. Policies are designed to be centrally managed at the organizational level (e.g. Security Compliance Team or Legal & Ethics Compliance Team).
- Standard: Standards are mandatory actions or rules that give formal policies support and direction by providing specific details that enable policies to be implemented. Standards may take the form of technical diagrams.
- Procedure: Procedures are detailed instructions to achieve a given policy and, if applicable, supporting standard and provid step-by-step instructions to follow. Procedures are decentralized and managed by process/control owners where a security control is translated into a business process.

### Creation

At minimum, controlled documents should cover the following key topic areas:

- Purpose: Overview of why the controlled document is being implemented.
- Scope: Who or what does the controlled document apply to.
- Roles & Responsibilities: Who is responsible for doing what. This should refer to departments or roles instead of specific individuals.
- Policy Statements, Standard or Procedure: The details.
- Exceptions: Define how exceptions to the controlled document will be tracked.
- References:  Procedure documents should map back to a governing policy or standard, and may relate to one or more procedures or other uncontrolled documentation.

### Publishing

Creation of, or changes to, controlled documents must be approved by management or a formally designated representative of the owning department as defined in the Code Owners file prior to publishing.

Most controlled documents will be published to our public facing handbook. However, if there is non public data included in the controlled document, it should be published via an *internal facing only* mechanism (e.g. an internal GitLab project or an internal only handbook page). Controlled documents should be accessible to all internal team members.

#### Handbook header

Controlled documents require a handbook frontmatter attribute for controlled documents to classify them. This attribute also renders a warning header.

For Controlled Documents that are audit-facing, please add the following label under the frontmatter.

``````

For Controlled Documents that are not audit-facing, please add the following label under the frontmatter.

``````

If you need an example of how to do this, please review this page in the WebIDE.

### Review

Controlled documents are required to be reviewed and approved on at least an annual basis. Controlled documents may be updated ad-hoc as required by business operations. Changes must be approved by a code owner of the controlled document prior to merge.

Reviewers of controlled documents are required to

1. Ensure that "say why not just what" transparency is easily understood in the description. The title should be concise but clear on the what.
1. Ensure that announcements for team members are scheduled (Slack, company newsletter), and tick off the MR template task.

## Exceptions

Exceptions to Controlled Documents must be tracked and approved by the Controlled Document approver(s) via an auditable format. An exception process should be defined in each document.

Information security considerations such as regulatory, compliance, confidentiality, integrity and availability requirements are most easily met when companies employ centrally supported or recommended industry standards. Whereas GitLab operates under the principle of least privilege, we understand that centrally supported or recommended industry technologies are not always feasible for a specific job function or company need. Exceptions from the aforementioned standard or recommended technologies is discouraged. However, it may be considered provided that there is a reasonable, justifiable business and/or research case for a Controlled Document exception; resources are sufficient to properly implement and maintain the alternative technology; the process outlined in this and other related documents is followed and other policies and standards are upheld.

In the event a team member requires an exception from the standard course of business or otherwise allowed by policy, the requester must submit an Exception Request to the Security Assurance Department, which contains, at a minimum, the elements outlined in the issue template.

Exception request approval requirements are documented within the issue template. The requester should tag the appropriate individuals who are required to provide an approval per the approval matrix.

If the business wants to appeal a decision, such appeal will be sent to Legal at legal@gitlab.com. Legal will draft an opinion as to the proposed risks to the company if the exception were to be granted. Legal’s opinion will be forwarded to the CEO and CFO for final disposition.

Any exception approval must:

- Recommended compensating controls to reduce exposure and/or harm (i.e. admin rights to financially significant system may require audit logs and review of users activity within the system)
- Be captured in the associated exception request issue. All sections in the "Approvals" area of the issue must be filled in.

Once an exception request is submitted, the following general flow will commence:

- Requestor will receive approval from their Department head or the policy, standard, or procedure maintainers, depending on the type of exception request.
- Once approved by the requstor's Department, the team that owns the associated document will review the exception request.
  - Security Compliance will determine whether the exception request has any current or planned compliance implications.
  - The Controlled Document Owner will review the request to ensure appropriate compensating controls have been documented and will consider inputs from Security Compliance and other SMEs when determining the overall level of risk associated with the request.
- The Controlled Document Owner will document a final decision, and if appropriate, a recommended action plan to mitigate risk from the exception request.
- The exception will be logged in the central exception management space.
- The exception will be reviewed as its expiration date approaches, and any extension of the exception will require a new and approved extension request.
